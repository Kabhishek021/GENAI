*Features
- Load research papers from a specified directory.
- Create vector embeddings using FAISS and Ollama/HuggingFace embeddings.
- Retrieve relevant document chunks based on user queries.
- Generate accurate responses using the Llama model via GROQ API.
- Display retrieved document chunks for reference.
